I dream that one day I'll be able to XXX. The chance to XXX would be very exciting. I think I'd really enjoy YYY. My friend Sam YYY once and he loved it.

Every day I like to XXX. I usually XXX first thing in the morning. After I'm finished YYY, I'm ready to start the day. This morning I YYY as usual.

Why won't John XXX? I want him to XXX. He's only tolerable when he's YYY. Like yesterday he YYY, and he was fine.

You should XXX. It's always worthwhile to XXX. I'm YYY, and you should too. Last week you YYY, why won't you now?

Jim loves to XXX all the time. It seems he was born to XXX. YYY is what he's good at. Last week he YYY six days out of seven.

Nobody wants to XXX these days. I don't know why people don't XXX. This country has a long tradition of YYY. Years ago everyone YYY and life was much better.

I don't want to XXX. I try not to XXX. I know that YYY isn't good for you. I know that because I YYY a lot when I was a teenager.

Fred couldn't XXX. All he wanted was to XXX. Finally, he succeeded in YYY. After he YYY his mind was at ease.

It's difficult to XXX. I've always found it hard to XXX. Some people say YYY is easy. But I YYY last week and I can tell you it's not easy.

Everyone wants to XXX. Magazines are telling me to XXX. It seems like YYY is cool. But I YYY last week, and I don't see what all the fuss is about.

Jane refuses to XXX. She's too frightened to XXX. I don't know why she's so scared of YYY. Everyone else YYY last year.

When I was a kid I used to XXX. My father taught me to XXX. I used to enjoy YYY very much. But I probably YYY one too many times.

Next week we're going to XXX. We've been waiting ages for the chance to XXX. We're reading a book about YYY. My friend YYY once before, but this will be my first time.

Nick tries to XXX every day. He gets off work early so he can XXX. He says that YYY holds his life together. But I YYY once, and it was nothing special.

In the 80s everyone used to XXX. If you didn't XXX, you weren't living. You could say YYY was the national pastime. Of course I YYY along with everyone else.
