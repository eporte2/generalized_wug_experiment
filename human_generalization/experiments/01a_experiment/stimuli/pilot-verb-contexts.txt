I dream that one day I'll be able to XXX. The chance to XXX would be very exciting. I think I'd really enjoy YYY. My friend Sam YYY once and he loved it.

Every day I like to XXX. I usually XXX first thing in the morning. After I'm finished YYY, I'm ready to start the day. This morning I YYY as usual.

Why won't John XXX? I want him to XXX. He's only tolerable when he's YYY. Like yesterday he YYY, and he was fine.

You should XXX. It's always worthwhile to XXX. I'm YYY, and you should too. Last week you YYY, why won't you now?

I don't want to XXX. I try not to XXX. I know that YYY isn't good for you. I know that because I YYY a lot when I was a teenager.

Fred couldn't XXX. All he wanted was to XXX. Finally, he succeeded in YYY. After he YYY his mind was at ease.

It's difficult to XXX. I've always found it hard to XXX. Some people say YYY is easy. But I YYY last week and I can tell you it's not easy.

Jane refuses to XXX. She's too frightened to XXX. I don't know why she's so scared of YYY. Everyone else YYY last year.

Next week we're going to XXX. We've been waiting ages for the chance to XXX. We're reading a book about YYY. My friend YYY once before, but this will be my first time.

Nick tries to XXX every day. He gets off work early so he can XXX. He says that YYY holds his life together. But I YYY once, and it was nothing special.
