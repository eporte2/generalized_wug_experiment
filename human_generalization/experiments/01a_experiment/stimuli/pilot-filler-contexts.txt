Everyone wants to XXX. Magazines are telling me to XXX. It seems like YYY is cool. But I YYY last week, and I don't see what all the fuss is about. (jog)

Nobody wants to XXX these days. I don't know why people don't XXX. This country has a long tradition of YYY. Years ago everyone YYY and life was much better. (farm)

When I was a kid I used to XXX. My father taught me to XXX. I used to enjoy YYY very much. But I probably YYY one too many times. (ski)

Jim loves to XXX all the time. It seems he was born to XXX. YYY is what he's good at. Last week he YYY six days out of seven. (paint)

I would like to have a XXX. They are great companions. I am envious of people who are fortunate enough to have more than one. If I could have many YYY, I would. (pets)

It is hard to believe that having a XXX is fine now. This would have been unacceptable in our day. We were always taught that YYY were bad. (tattoo)

Did they ask about the XXX? I think we need to let them know by tomorrow. I hear YYY are in scarce quantity at the store. (cake)

I met a XXX person today. I don't think I've ever met anyone so XXX. They were definitely the YYY person I've met. They were even YYY than you. (tall)

XXX things are nice. Some people disagree, but quite a few think XXX things are great. Well, at least everyone can agree that the YYY one of all is nice. Nothing is YYY than this one. (soft)

Why are XXX pants popular? Most find XXX pants uncomfortable. For some reason though, people still try to wear the YYY ones they can find, always looking for a YYY pair than the last. (tight)
