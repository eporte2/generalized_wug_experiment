This is a XXX. Now there is another one. There are two of them. There are two YYY.

My favorite animal is the XXX. They are impressive creatures. I saw a group of YYY during our trip last summer and I was so excited.

Have you ever heard of a XXX? It grows in South America. There are YYY on the menu tonight for dinner.

The XXX was on the counter this morning. Dad doesn't know where it went. We can buy a few more YYY at the store later though.

There was a group of kids playing with a XXX down the street. Did you see it? I think it might be one of Terry's YYY.

Did you give him a XXX for his birthday like he asked? I think they are his favorite. He will be asking you for some YYY, I know it.

The camera followed the XXX for some time. It was on its way to meet other YYY near the beach.

The officer wondered if this XXX had been left behind on purpose. YYY were not known to wander off on their own.

Sam had left the building without her XXX. She told herself that there would be plenty of people with YYY that worked when she got there.

There was no doubt in my mind that a great XXX like this one was John's. I had seen a set of YYY in his yard last summer and this had to be one of them.
